connectfour
===========

Not the most secure app, since the global game.player variable is available for a user to change, but it serves its purpose. Needs more testing.

Unit Tests
-----------
Available in connectfour.test.js, below are the self-explanatory functions

* c4t.horizontalTest()
* c4t.verticalTest()
* c4t.diagonalTestNESW()
* c4t.diagonalTestNWSE()

TODO
-----------
* Get the game's logic out of the globals.
* Make blue legs
* Profit
